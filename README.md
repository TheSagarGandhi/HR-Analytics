Tools: Google BigQuery, Google Looker Studio, SQL
Project Type: Data Visualization & Analysis

Created two interactive dashboards (Employee Demographics & Employee Performance & Satisfaction) using Google Looker Studio based on cleaned and transformed datasets.

Wrote optimized SQL queries in BigQuery to:

Generate new features (e.g., full employee name, age bins, salary bins, state names).

Join datasets (EmployeeDataset, EducationLevel, PerformanceRating, SatisfactionLevel, and RatingLevel) to form comprehensive tables (table1 and table2) for analysis.

Identify and handle null values and duplicate records to maintain data integrity.

Designed clear visualizations for KPIs like:

Attrition trends by department and age group

Job satisfaction vs. years with the current manager

Salary distributions by education, department, and job role

Training effectiveness based on performance ratings

Enabled HR and management teams to derive actionable insights from employee performance and retention trends.
